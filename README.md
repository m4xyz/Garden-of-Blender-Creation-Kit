# Garden-of-Blender-Creation-Kit
 Simple console-application to create whole directories/projects-folders for Blender (also could be used for any other case).

 The application could have (will have) bugs, so expect it to work abnormally.

# Creating a project
 1. Specify the path to the folder where your projects will be created.
 2. Specify the path of a template-folder, the folder which will be used to create your project.
 3. Use the 'create <InsertProjectName>'-command to create a project.

# Notes on the template-folder
 Every file in any folder inside of the template-folder will be renamed to the project-name which is specified in the 'create'-command. This does not include the file-type/ending.
 Also, exceeding a total length of somewhat over ~240 characters in the path of any subfolder of the template-folder, will leed to a crash of the program. So consider placing the template-folder somewhere where there are not much subfolders involved (for example \Documents).

 # Installing
  1. Download the latest release.
  2. Unzip the folder.
  3. Run the 'setup.exe'
  4. Start 'Garden of Blender Creation Kit' as you would start any other program.

 Windows will try to protect you by warning you, that this software my cause damage to your computer.
